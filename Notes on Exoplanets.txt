Exoplanets: https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/?intent=021#/2

What are they?
 Planet outside our solar system that usually orbits another star in our galaxy
 Most Exoplantes are discovered in a small region of the Milky Way, but still 
 far for a mission to be sent, with the closest one being 4 light years away from Earth. 

Exploration of Exoplanets
    They are very hard to see because they are very far and their brigthness is
    usually hidden by their own Star. 
    From data like weight, distance and mass we can infer things about their 
    temperature, volume, atmospheres, etc.

Why do we study Exoplanets?
    We wan to understand what a habitable planet looks like, and understanding
    what other kinds of worlds are possible out there. As well as exploring the
    history of the universe.

How to discover Exoplanets?
    There are five methods: Transit Method, Radial Velocity, Direct Imaging,
    Gravitational Microlensing, Astrometry

    The method that has discovered the most exoplanets is Transit method

Transit Method
    During an Eclipse, the Moon transiting in between the Earth and Sun, blocks 
    some of the light from the Sun for a period of time, making it dimmer. 
    As we remember, Exoplanets orbit around a Star, which are often observable 
    from Earth with the help of telescopes. When the Exoplanet orbits between 
    that Star and the Earth, we observe changes in the brigthness.
    These changes are subtle enough to suggest the presence of a planet. 

What else do we know?
    The Transit Method is also useful to understand the atmospheric composition
    of the Exoplanet. As light passes through the atmosphere, the resulting spectrum 
    and light allows scientists to determine which elements are present
