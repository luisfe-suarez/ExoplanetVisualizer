ORBITS: For simplification purposes asumme orbits are circular 

Circular orbits:
For an orbit in a circumferences with radius 'r' and period 'P':
    Angular Velocity: radians / seconds
        W = 2π / P 
    Speed of object: 
        V = 2πr / p or Wr
    Angle formed:
        Θ =  2πt / p or Wt for some time 't'

    Transit:
    If looked from a 2D plane, it happens when the position of the 
    planet in some time t "x(t)" equals 0. 
    Considering the location of a point in a circumference, the location of 
    the planet in some time t is given by:
        x(t) = r * cos(Θ) = r * cos(Wt)

    Determine if transit is happening: 
        Transit when the projected distance between the Star Center and the planet 
        is less than the sum of Radius of the bodies.
        d(t) = sqrt(x(t)^2 + y(t)^2) 



Transit Method: Simplication - Use a simple geometric model
    Graph would have Flux as the y-axis and time as the x-axis 
    Flux is defined as:
        F(t) = 1 - (Rp)^2 / (Rs)^2 if there is intersection 
        F(t) = 1 otherwise

DATA REQUIRED: 
    - Period of transit of the planet
    - Radius of the orbit 
    - Radius of each Planet
